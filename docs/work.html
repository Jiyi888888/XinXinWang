          <div class="artwork-info">
            <h3>Threaded Memory</h3>
            <p>Discarded chairs are cocooned in recycled yarn, preserving them as vessels of memory. This work questions what we keep, what we throw away, and how care can be stitched into the everyday.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Artwork 2 -->
        <div class="artwork-item">
          <img src="assets/artworks/home-2.jpeg" alt="Opera Bound">
          <div class="artwork-info">
            <h3>Opera Bound</h3>
            <p>Using waste yarn to wrap broken chair frames, this piece echoes the theatricality of the Royal Opera House. The act of binding turns discarded furniture into a stage for sustainable narratives.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Artwork 3 -->
        <div class="artwork-item">
          <img src="assets/artworks/home-3.jpeg" alt="Silent Audience">
          <div class="artwork-info">
            <h3>Silent Audience</h3>
            <p>A cluster of yarn-bound chairs stands like absent spectators. Once discarded, these seats are reimagined as ghostly presences, reminding us of overproduction, consumption, and forgotten voices.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Artwork 4 -->

          <div class="artwork-info">
            <h3>Knotting Histories</h3>
            <p>Each knot marks a gesture of repair. By recycling chairs and enveloping them in yarn, this piece maps sustainability through time, craft, and storytelling.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Artwork 5 -->
        <div class="artwork-item">
          <img src="assets/artworks/home-5.jpeg" alt="Entangled Voices">
          <div class="artwork-info">
            <h3>Entangled Voices</h3>
            <p>Like the layered harmonies of an opera chorus, threads of reclaimed fibre entwine around a chair, symbolising the interconnectedness of voices, histories, and ecologies.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Artwork 6 -->
        <div class="artwork-item">
          <img src="assets/artworks/home-6.jpeg" alt="Reclothed Chair">
          <div class="artwork-info">
            <h3>Reclothed Chair</h3>
            <p>Furniture once destined for landfill is given a new skin of recycled yarns. The act of “reclothing” transforms waste into a second life, highlighting slow fashion principles in sculptural form.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Artwork 7 -->
        <div class="artwork-item">
          <img src="assets/artworks/home-7.jpeg" alt="Binding Silence">
          <div class="artwork-info">
            <h3>Binding Silence</h3>
            <p>Discarded chairs are restrained by layers of yarn, creating tension between freedom and preservation. The work examines the silence of objects discarded and the possibility of renewal.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Artwork 8 -->
        <div class="artwork-item">
          <img src="assets/artworks/home-8.jpeg" alt="Echo Seat">
          <div class="artwork-info">
            <h3>Echo Seat</h3>
            <p>Wrapped in threads, the chair resonates like an echo chamber of past uses. It honours forgotten objects while proposing a circular design future.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Artwork 9 -->
        <div class="artwork-item">
          <img src="assets/artworks/home-9.jpeg" alt="The Staged Thread">
          <div class="artwork-info">
            <h3>The Staged Thread</h3>
            <p>Evoking stage curtains and opera sets, this recycled chair draped in threads transforms furniture into spectacle, questioning the boundary between performance and sustainability.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Artwork 10 -->
        <div class="artwork-item">
          <img src="assets/artworks/home-10.jpeg" alt="Sustain / Restrain">
          <div class="artwork-info">
            <h3>Sustain / Restrain</h3>
            <p>This duality piece highlights how binding protects discarded objects while also restricting them. The use of waste yarn reflects both fragility and resilience in sustainable practice.</p>
