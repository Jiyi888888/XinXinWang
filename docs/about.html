        <p>
          Xinxin Wang is a London–Shanghai–based artist specializing in sustainable textile art. With 10 years of experience in advertising and fashion marketing in Shanghai, she began exploring her artistic vision during her MA Sustainable Fashion studies at Kingston School of Art, London, UK. Where she developed a practice rooted in creative innovation and ethical thinking. Growing environmental awareness inspired her parallel path into sustainable textile art, while she continues to value her expertise in marketing and advertising.
        </p>

        <p>
          With a ground-up approach grounded in creative innovation, ethical thinking, and environmental responsibility, Xinxin transforms recycled garments, reclaimed yarns, surplus fabrics, and repurposed materials into expressive, resonant artworks. A defining strand of her work reimagines discarded fabrics from the Royal Opera House, repurposing these institutional remnants into new textile compositions that question entrenched notions of value, beauty, and waste. Through this process, Xinxin reclaims the hidden narratives woven into each fragment, offering audiences a chance to rethink consumption, reuse, and the lifecycle of materials.

        <!-- add a touch more space before the principles line -->
        <p style="margin-top:24px;"><strong>Her artistic vision is guided by three core principles:</strong></p>
        <ul style="margin:0 0 16px 20px;">
          <li style="margin-bottom:8px;">
            <strong>Material Respect:</strong> Each fabric embodies stories of creation, performance, and passage stories she elevates through her crafted transformations.
          </li>
          <li style="margin-bottom:8px;">
            <strong>Environmental Advocacy:</strong> Xinxin’s practice aligns with circular fashion ideals, emphasizing reduction of resource use and revaluation of the discarded as creative potential.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cross-Cultural Insight:</strong> Drawing inspiration from living and working in both London and Shanghai, her art reflects a rich dialogue across diverse cultural and sustainability contexts.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Xinxin embraces craft as activism, weaving material histories with contemporary purpose. Her work is both poetic and probing: a call to reframe how we perceive beauty, utility, and environmental stewardship in a constantly evolving material world.
